User Guide
==========

The Nirvana library is split into two parts:

#. The low-level interface is a thin Python layer on top of NirvanaHQ's API.
   It allows your Python programs to make calls directly with the API.
   Using the library at this level requires knowledge of the API that can
   be obtained from their API documentation.

#. The high-level interface builds on top of the low-level interface to
   provide nice, object-oriented, *pythonic* access to a user's tasks and
   related data. This is the way most developers will use this library.
   The documentation on this site should be sufficient for Using the
   library at this level. NirvanaHQ's API documentation should not be
   required.
