Supported Pythons and Platforms
-------------------------------

Python 2.6 and 2.7 are currently supported. There are no plans to support
2.5, but 3.x is `coming "soon"
<https://github.com/njwilson/nirvana-python/issues/1>`_.

I develop and test this library on Mac and Linux. I'd like to be friendly
to other platforms (e.g., Windows) as well, but it may be a while before I
get around to setting up a development environment under Windows to test
it.
