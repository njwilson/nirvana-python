Documentation TODOs
===================

This document lists any TODO items found in the documentation using the
`sphinx.ext.todo <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/todo.html>`_ extension to
Sphinx. If nothing shows up here, either there are no TODOs or, more
likely, the ``todo_include_todos`` option was not set in Sphinx when this
documentation was built.
